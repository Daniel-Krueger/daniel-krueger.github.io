# WEBCON BPS online demo

You can experience what it’s like to start processes, respond to tasks, track
work, and analyze reports from these 20 sample solutions:

| Advances                 | Employee onboarding  | Invoice processing  | Marketing orders |
| Car fleet administration | Expense report       | IT Asset Management | Press releases   |
| Change requests          | Helpdesk & ticketing | IT system registry  | Sales activities |
| Consultations            | HR requests          | Leave of absence    | Training courses |
| Employee onboarding      | Investments          | Mailroom            | Travel request   |


There’s nothing to install; just register and browse to the portal to try it
out. The solutions are ready-made, and you get to try them from the end-user
perspective. These sample solutions were made to be easily understood by WEBCON.
If you’d like to try modifying/improving them, or building original applications
of your own, check out the other two options.

# WEBCON BPS Express freemium

If you have any local or online infrastructure available, you can download and
install the WEBCON BPS Express edition. What’s the meaning of freemium though?

| Benefits                           | Limitations                                                |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| It’s free.                             | **10 GB database limit**                                       |
| It **never expires**.                  | **Single Environment** (no dev-to-test-to-production scenario) |
| You can even **use it in production**. |                                                                |

The main limitation is the 10 GB database limit, there aren’t any features
missing in the Express version.

The minimum requirements for any WEBCON BPS installation are:

-   Windows Server 2012 R2 or newer with IIS

In case you want to know more about the architecture or how a **setup for over ten
thousand** users looks, take a look at the infrastructure guide and scroll down:

# Application templates

There are 26 freely available application templates. You can import these in
Designer Studio and give them a try. If they don’t quite fit, make them your
own. In case of question just drop me a message.

# Transferring processes between hosting options

Yes, you are understand this correctly, if you started with an online trial you
can export your applications and import them in your own WEBCON BPS environment.
Of course, this applies vice versa if you started with an own environment and
you want to move to the cloud. Perhaps I shouldn’t have used “Of course”, but
that’s the WEBCON way.
