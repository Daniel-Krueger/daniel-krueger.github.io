# Speed is not enough
Mike Fitzmaurice said once[^1]

>The demand for applications in today's business world is unprecedented, but:
>- Quality cannot be compromised for speed.
>- It's not enough to build applications quickly and easily.
>- Our platform supports the entire application lifecycle
>- They need to be enterprise-grade, which means more than just scalability.
>- It allows you to deliver future-proof apps that grow and evolve along with your company.‚Äù

[^1]: Mike is Chief Evangelist & VP WEBCON North America. Unfortunately, the page is not longer available from which I took the words.

Is this just marketing talk[^2], or is it real?

[^2]: I don't intend to offend anyone from marketing. I'm just a practical person who prefers tables with technical details over beautifully designed slides and similar. ;)
This is a question one can answer only for oneself, but my posts may provide insides for such a decision.
In the past six month I've shared 16 reasons why I still love implementing applications with WEBCON BPS, even so I'm using it for more than five years. Below you find an overview which of my posts contribute to which topic.
