# YouTube Live event
This is an announcement for my first:\
 'Ask Me Anything: WEBCON BPS' live event on 23<sup>rd</sup> January

Unfortunately I haven't found any way to configure a time zone or length of the event. The event should start at 5 pm CET. I have no idea how long it will take, this will depend on the questions. It may take 30 minutes, 60 minutes but I think I would end the event at 90 minutes maximum. 

I know WEBCON BPS, I tested YouTube Live, but you never know what will happen.  :)

# Target group
You don't need to be experienced in WEBCON BPS, if you are wondering how and whether you could solve a problem /digitize a process with WEBCON BPS you are welcome too.

# Asking questions
## Before the event
You can send me question in advance:
- Via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krueger-daniel/).
- Via mail listed on my LinkedIn profile.
- WEBCON Community.
- As a comment to the [YouTube Live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcR7GRaVRbs) or the chat, if this is already possible.
- As a comment to the [LinkedIn event](https://www.linkedin.com/events/.askmeanyhting-webconbps7141826121553084416/)
- As a comment to this post.
 

## During the event
If you have a question /comment during the event, you can post it via the chat. If something is interesting for others too, you could use reactions. This will make it easier for me to identify these.

I will try my best to keep track with the chat. 

If I don't receive any questions in advance, I will just start the Ask Me Anything with my approach on how I display parent workflow data in a sub workflow.


## After the event
What will happen with unanswered questions? In case this happens, I will answer have in mind to answer them one way or the other:
- Comment
- Blog post 
- A follow up video, which is not live.
- Another Ask me Anything episode

At least I assume, that there will be at least a second episode. :)

## Type of questions
As the title suggest you can ask me anything, but there are areas in which I have no experience at all:
- Barcodes 
- Large databases 
- Mail approval
- OCR
- Performance indicators
- WEBCON BPS AI

That doesn't mean you can't ask, but there's a high chance that I either don't know the answer or I'm not confident of the answer, as I have no practical experience. In other areas my experience ranges from "There's a chance that my answer is wrong" to "I'm sure the answer is correct."

If there are questions related to integrating ERP systems, I have only experience with Business Central. 

The questions can be either in English or German, I don't speak any other language.
